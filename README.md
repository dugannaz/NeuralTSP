## A Travelling Salesman Problem (TSP) Solver

(This is currently more like a visualization tool than solver.)

Neuron Solver:

Each node of TSP is a neuron with certain number of connections.

Each node tries to connect to closest neighbors by querying its connections. Queries with certain depth are possible.

Matrix Solver:

Optimization using swap operations on distance matrix
